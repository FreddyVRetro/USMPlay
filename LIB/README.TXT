
   makefile and makefile.r are the makefiles to build watcom C usmplay
 library. (Stack calling convention and register calling convention)

  The files are build with the case sensitive option. (/mx tasm parameter)

  I have added the makefile to help you to build an EOS library, it may be
usefull... (The first Useless usefull file ! :-) )

And a little advice: USE TASM 4.0 !
